Hi Monkeys (CDP Gray reference here)

Here's Lyanlima. I finished AP Compsci A last year, and touched a bit of machine learning (only having some surface knowledge about neural nets). I'm currently doing some app designing with java and more machine learning with r? potentially.

I like to draw, especially anime girls hhh, and just started animating. Gonna start college app next year, so I'll probably not have much time to code except for the school robotics team.

Nice to me you all ^-^.
